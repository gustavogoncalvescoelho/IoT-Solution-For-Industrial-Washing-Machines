# IoT_Solution_For_Industrial_Washing_Machines
The codes provided here were used as a part of the thesis developed by Gustavo Gonçalves Coelho titled 'Development of an IoT solution for detergent supervision in Industrial Washing Machines', which is a dissertation that was submitted to the School of Technology and Management of the Polytechnic Institute of Bragança to obtain the Master Degree in Industrial Engineering.

The level measurement systems, as well as all industrial automation activities, aim to improve the efficiency of the productive processes, reducing costs and increasing safety. In industrial laundries, the level measurement is a key element for asset management, mainly due to the necessity of maintain a continuous flow of washing processes. Therefore, the present work presents a solution of optimization problems using IoT technologies, together with the development of an integrated measurement system, capable of monitoring and recording the liquid level surface in real time. Thereby, a microcontrolled system was developed to perform level measurements using an ultrasonic sensor, in which data is sent to a database and, through a web platform, the client can remotely access the measurement results. In order to integrate the system, a custom-made 3D device was designed and printed to be implemented in the industrial laundry reservoirs of Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Bragança, in Portugal.
